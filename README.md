# DDoS-Attack-Tracker
DDoS Attack Tracker is a tool designed to track and analyze DDoS attacks. It uses Python for data processing and Cassandra, a NoSQL database, for storage. The main goal is to provide real-time monitoring of DDoS attacks, store attack data for later analysis, and offer an intuitive interface for visualizing this data.
